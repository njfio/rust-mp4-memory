{"id":0,"text":"This is a sample text file for testing the performance improvements in rust_mem_vid.\n\nThe new implementation includes several key optimizations:\n\n1. Parallel Frame Processing\n   - Frames are now saved in parallel batches\n   - Adaptive batch sizing based on dataset size\n   - Real-time progress reporting\n\n2. Streaming Processing for Large Datasets\n   - Automatic detection of large datasets (>1000 chunks)\n   - Memory-efficient streaming processing\n   - Constant memory usage regardless of dataset size\n\n3. Enhanced User Experience\n   - Progress indicators during encoding\n   - Performance tips for large datasets\n   - Better error messages and guidance\n\n4. Improved Statistics\n   - Compression ratio reporting\n   - Detailed timing information\n   - Performance recommendations\n\nThis sample file should be processed quickly using the batch processing mode\nsince it's relatively small. The system will automatically choose the most\nefficient processing method based on the dataset size.","frame":0,"metadata":{"id":0,"source":"test_sample.txt","page":null,"char_offset":0,"length":984,"frame":0,"extra":{}}}
